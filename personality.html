			<p>Hello there! I'm Kailin Hu. This personal website has been completed by my personal self-study. My major is Media Studies, but I want to learn more skills to support my profession. After completing the introductory study of python in school, I started to learn through online instructional videos, studying processing in addition to Hbuilder. The collision of art and computers is interesting, as well as the combination of sensibility and rationality. I hope to utilize this computer content of mine to help me achieve my dreams in my future career path.</p>
